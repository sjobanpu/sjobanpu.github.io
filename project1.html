        <b><mark class="maroon"><font size=+3>01</font> PROBLEM STATEMENT</mark></b><br>In 2017, drastic cuts were made to Pittsburgh's Port Authority bus system. Numerous routes were eliminated<br>causing problems for many faculty and staff at Carnegie Mellon, especially those that live-off campus. For my<br>User Centered Research class, we used several methods to analyze our key clients: students at Carnegie Mellon<br>along with other stakeholders. In teams, we also prepared solutions to potentially reducing<br>the effect of these cuts on students.

       <b><mark class="maroon"><font size=+3>02</font> PROCESS</mark></b><br>This semester long project began with interviews conducted on our stakeholders, ranging from students to administraton <br>to better understand the issue at hand and what the overall consensus is regarding transportation at Carnegie Mellon.<br>After several interviews, we aggregated the data to build models and affinity diagrams on key problems. From there we<br>were able to develop several ideas for solutions, storyboard and collect feedback, and come up with our final solution:<br>a ridesharing contract with Uber where students could get cheaper rides during certain hours of the nights on weekdays.<br>This project was really interesting because at the time I was working on a student government project to bring UberPool<br>to campus. This allowed me to gain fresh insight on what was feasible on campus and even within the Pittsburgh city limits.

    <div class="StoryboardSelection one"><mark class="maroon"><b><font size=+3>04</font> STORYBOARDING</mark></b><br>For storyboarding, we presented three solutions to the cuts on Port Authority:<br>more cheap on-campus housing, kiosks/heated stations so waiting for the<br>bus wouldn't be as strenuous, and using some sort of cheaper ridesharing service.
